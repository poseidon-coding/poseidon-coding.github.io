I recently read about the [pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique); a method to improve productivity at work by breaking the day in to 25 minute portions, working until a standard kitchen timer times out.  Of course in the workplace with others around, this can cause bother as the alarm rings.  The solution was to use an electric timer, replacing the beeper with an LED.  The timer I bought – a Salter mini timer – uses a 1.5v watch battery. It is very hard to find an LED with a forward voltage small enough to illuminate the light. This [maplins](http://www.maplin.co.uk/3mm-super-bright-leds-587260) LED was the only one capable of being lit by the voltage (ideally requiring a 1.85v power supply). A hole was drilled in the top of the timer, detaching the beeper and soldering the diode to the cables that I left attached to the Printed Circuit Board. Here is the result.
